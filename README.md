# 🌸 Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset

This project performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on the famous *Iris dataset* using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

The goal is to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset before applying any machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Dataset

The Iris_flower_data_set is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning. It includes 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species.

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## 🔍 Objectives of the Project

- Load and understand the dataset structure
- Perform univariate and multivariate analysis
- Generate descriptive statistics
- Visualize relationships between features
- Compare the distributions across the different species

## 📊 Libraries Used

- pandas – Data handling and summary statistics
- matplotlib – Basic plotting
- seaborn – Advanced data visualization

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Histograms
- Boxplots
- Pairplots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Violin plots

## 🔬 Key Insights

- Setosa is easily separable from the other two species
- Petal length and petal width are the most useful features for classification
- There is a strong positive correlation between petal length and petal width

## ▶ How to Run

Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fouzan571/eda-iris-dataset.git
